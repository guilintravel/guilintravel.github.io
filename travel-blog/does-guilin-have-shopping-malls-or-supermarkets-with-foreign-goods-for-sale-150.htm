                                                <p>Guilin, a city known for its stunning natural landscapes, such as the picturesque <strong>Li River</strong> and the striking <strong>Karst Mountains</strong>, is a popular tourist destination in China. As tourism continues to grow, so does the demand for international products and goods. For travelers, expats, and locals alike, it is no surprise that the availability of foreign products in Guilin’s shopping malls and supermarkets has become a significant consideration. While the city offers many local shops, markets, and specialty stores, finding foreign goods can sometimes be a challenge. However, there are plenty of places where you can find international products, ranging from food items to cosmetics and electronics.</p><h3>1. Supermarkets in Guilin: A Global Shopping Experience</h3><p>While you might not expect to find an overwhelming number of international supermarkets in a city like Guilin, there are a number of chain stores and local supermarkets where foreign goods can be purchased. The most popular supermarkets that cater to both local and international tastes are often found in shopping malls or near tourist-heavy areas.</p><h4>Carrefour (家乐福)</h4><p>Carrefour is a well-known French supermarket chain that operates in many major cities across China, including Guilin. This large, hypermarket-style store offers a wide range of products, including a diverse selection of imported goods. If you're in need of familiar foreign products like sauces, canned goods, snacks, beverages, and even baby food, Carrefour is an excellent option. Many international brands are represented here, offering a taste of home for expatriates and tourists.</p><p>In addition to food items, Carrefour in Guilin also stocks household goods, health and beauty products, and a selection of foreign-brand electronics. For international tourists who are seeking convenience, Carrefour is a great one-stop shopping destination for both local and international products.</p><h4>Metro (麦德龙)</h4><p>Another large supermarket chain that offers imported goods is <strong>Metro</strong>. Metro caters more to wholesalers and business clients but also welcomes individual customers, especially those looking for international products in larger quantities. The store is well-stocked with food items from around the world, including European, American, and Asian brands. This is especially useful for expats who may be seeking specific imported items that are harder to find in other local stores.</p><p>Metro also sells a range of international alcohol, dairy products, and snacks. Their prices tend to be more competitive compared to smaller grocery stores, but do keep in mind that some of the products here may come with a higher price tag due to import costs. Nevertheless, it’s a reliable place to find both food and non-food products that aren’t readily available in local stores.</p><h4>Wal-Mart (沃尔玛)</h4><p>Though Wal-Mart is an American-based supermarket chain, it has been operating in China for many years and has expanded its offerings to meet local demand. In <strong>Guilin</strong>, Wal-Mart stores are popular for providing a mix of local and imported goods. The imported items available at Wal-Mart tend to be less specialized than those at Carrefour or Metro, but you can still find a good selection of snacks, beverages, cleaning products, and household items from international brands.</p><p>The Wal-Mart stores in Guilin may have slightly fewer international products than Carrefour or Metro, but it still serves as a convenient option for tourists who are looking for some familiar products or essentials.</p><h4>Auchan (欧尚)</h4><p>Another French chain that has a presence in Guilin is <strong>Auchan</strong>, which is similar to Carrefour in terms of its broad selection of international products. Auchan offers a wide variety of imported food, from dairy products to sauces, snacks, and beverages. You'll also find international cosmetics brands, pet products, and household items.</p><p>If you’re seeking high-quality imported ingredients for cooking, Auchan is one of the top places to explore. Many expatriates living in Guilin frequent Auchan for its diverse selection of foreign goods. It’s also a good place to find imported wines and spirits, as well as seasonal products from different parts of the world.</p><h3>2. International Malls and Shopping Centers in Guilin</h3><p>Beyond supermarkets, Guilin also features a number of shopping malls and department stores where foreign goods are available. These malls usually have sections or dedicated floors for international brands, ranging from fashion and beauty to food products.</p><h4>Zhengyang Pedestrian Street (正阳步行街)</h4><p><strong>Zhengyang Pedestrian Street</strong> is a well-known shopping area in the city center that has both local stores and international retailers. This area is famous for its array of shops, restaurants, and cafes, making it a lively spot for both tourists and locals. The street features stores selling clothing, accessories, souvenirs, and many other items, including foreign goods.</p><p>While it’s more focused on fashion and souvenirs, there are a few shops in the area that sell imported food, snacks, and beverages. The local shops might not have the same variety as the larger supermarkets, but they still offer a range of goods from other countries. It’s a great spot to browse for unique souvenirs or snacks that might remind you of home.</p><h4>Guilin Department Store (桂林百货大楼)</h4><p>This well-established department store in Guilin offers a range of products, from household goods to clothing and electronics. In addition to local Chinese brands, you can also find international brand names, especially in the beauty and cosmetics sections. Guilin Department Store is more focused on retail shopping, but you can still find imported goods from popular international labels. If you’re looking for foreign cosmetics or health products, this department store is one of the better places to visit.</p><p>Although the store is not as focused on imported food items as some of the supermarkets, you will find a selection of non-food products from other countries, including fashion and household items.</p><h4>Liangjiang International Mall (两江国际购物中心)</h4><p>For a more upscale shopping experience, the <strong>Liangjiang International Mall</strong> is a modern and large-scale shopping center that features several international brands. Here, visitors can find a range of foreign products, including clothing, electronics, home goods, and cosmetics. The mall also offers a variety of international restaurants and cafes, providing a global experience within Guilin.</p><p>If you’re looking for high-end international fashion or luxury items, Liangjiang International Mall is the best option in the city. Many popular global brands have a presence in this mall, making it a great destination for those looking to shop for international goods.</p><h3>3. Specialty Stores and Local Markets with Imported Goods</h3><p>While the large supermarkets and shopping malls are excellent places to find foreign products, you can also discover some smaller specialty stores or local markets offering international goods. These stores typically carry products from specific countries or regions, such as European chocolate, American snacks, or Japanese tea. If you are looking for unique products that are not available in mainstream stores, these specialty stores can be a treasure trove.</p><h4>Local Specialty Stores</h4><p>In addition to the larger chains, there are smaller stores around the city that specialize in international food, beverages, and other products. For instance, you can find small shops that import snacks and beverages from the U.S., Europe, or Japan. These stores might not have a wide selection, but they often offer niche products that aren’t available elsewhere in Guilin.</p><h4>Foreign Grocery Stores</h4><p>Some smaller grocery stores in Guilin focus exclusively on imported goods. These stores can be a bit more expensive, but they cater to expatriates and tourists who need specific foreign products. Items like cheese, wine, pasta, cereals, and sauces from Europe or the U.S. are typically available in such stores. Additionally, many of these stores offer international magazines and newspapers, making them a good place for expatriates to pick up familiar reading material.</p><h3>4. Online Shopping for Foreign Goods in Guilin</h3><p>If you’re unable to find the international products you’re looking for in physical stores, online shopping is always an option. Several e-commerce platforms in China allow international shipping or offer products from abroad. For example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>TaoBao</strong> (淘宝): TaoBao is one of the largest online marketplaces in China, and it’s possible to find a wide range of international products here, including imported food, clothing, electronics, and beauty products. Many international sellers use TaoBao to reach Chinese consumers, and you can have goods shipped directly to Guilin.</p></li><li><p><strong>JD.com</strong> (京东): JD.com is another popular online shopping platform in China that often carries imported products. If you’re unable to find certain foreign goods in stores, JD.com is an excellent option for purchasing them online.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kaola</strong> (考拉): Kaola is an online platform specializing in imported goods, ranging from beauty products to groceries and health supplements. Kaola offers a curated selection of international products, often from top global brands, and delivers directly to consumers in China.</p></li></ul><p>While shopping online in China can be a convenient option for international goods, it’s important to remember that delivery times may vary, and shipping fees may apply. However, if you’re seeking specific foreign products, online platforms can provide a broader range of options.</p><h3>5. Conclusion</h3><p>Guilin may not have as many dedicated international supermarkets or malls as larger cities like Beijing or Shanghai, but there are still plenty of places to find foreign goods. Whether you’re exploring large supermarkets like Carrefour, Metro, or Auchan, or shopping at local specialty stores and international malls, the options are diverse. For those who can’t find what they need in-store, online shopping platforms like TaoBao, JD.com, and Kaola offer an easy alternative for accessing international products.</p><p>While there might be fewer foreign products available compared to other major cities, the increasing demand for international goods in Guilin makes it easier than ever for expatriates and travelers to enjoy familiar tastes and products.</p>                <div class="clearfix"></div>
